            Independence Day

        <ul>
            <li>After decades of political turmoil, British rule officially ended in India on 15th August 1947</li>
            <li>The momentous occasion also witnessed the bloody partition of the country into India and Pakistan (which included present-day Bangladesh)</li>
            <li>A national holiday, Independence Day is observed throughout India with flag-hoisting ceremonies, parades and cultural events</li>
            <li>This 15th of August, India will celebrate 75 years of Independence. We as Indians pay respect to all the leaders who fought bravely for our nation's freedom in the past. On Independence Day 2022, the Prime Minister of India will hoist our tricolour flag at the Red Fort, Old Delhi. He will also deliver a speech to the nation as well. However, all cultural programs and school celebrations won't occur this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Independence day i.e. the 15th of August is declared as a national holiday which means every government office, post offices, banks and stores will remain shut.</li>
            <li>For many years India was under the British Raj. The East India Company ruled India for about 100 years. It was in 1757 when the East India Company won the battle of Plassey. It was after the win that the Company started exerting power over India. Our nation had its rebellion against the foreign rule for the first time in 1957. The entire country united against British power. It was an unfortunate event as India was defeated back then but after that time. Indian rule was then passed to the British who ruled our country till India got its independence. Our country faced a long campaign to gain independence. Britain then began to weaken after two world wars and India was finally free. India's freedom struggle has always been an inspiration to the world as it was the most non-violent campaign in the world.</li>
            <li>This day reminds us of all the sacrifices that were made by our freedom fighters in order to set India free from British rule. 15th August is a national holiday and the day is then celebrated with flag hoisting, parades and cultural events.</li>
